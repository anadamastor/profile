      <h2>I like nuts.🐿️</h2>

      <p>"I (Ervis) met Alfredo during the first lockdown and it was love at first sight. He looked at me in the eyes and I melted. Then he'd come and visit every day during lunch. We'd eat together, nuts. Most of the time we were silent but our connection sublimated at a higher level than words. Also, Alfredo cannot speak English. Sometimes I think it wasn't love, just hunger. But how could you resist this face? It was until last month that he started to change. Stopped eating the food I'd prepare for him and started eating my rose's buds, staring at me. I think it quickly became a toxic relationship that I had to stop. Haven't heard from him in months. I hope the fox did not feast with his magnificent little body."</p>
